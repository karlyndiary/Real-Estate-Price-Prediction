Real estate prices are influenced by various factors, making them complex to predict. In this project, we focus on the Bangalore dataset to understand property pricing. Using linear regression, we aim to analyze how factors like location, size and amenities affect housing prices. Our goal is to provide valuable insights for both homebuyers and industry professionals.
